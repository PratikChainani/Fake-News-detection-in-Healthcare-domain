Overview: 
In the past years social media platforms like twitter ,whatsapp, facebook have become a source of spreading information quickly and widely . With the easy internet accessibility , people are free to spread information that they believe . This fake information is dreadful especially if it's related to healthcare . Fake remedies , theories with no proper evidence about illness are spreaded all over the internet . In the current times of pandemic , all our phones were buzzing with made-up theories, remedies, and diagnosis of the virus.Social media has seen a surge in spreading information . It is helpful but there is a need for verification of such information. We have classified news on the basis of language used in tweets along with judging the authenticity of links shared and the people tagged.
Considering the havoc that people have created on social media platforms in this pandemic, by spreading news with respect to covid-19 regarding its treatment, cure, precautions, etc. we decided to streamline everything and confirm whether the news spread by them is genuine or not. So, we decided to come up with something that could confirm the genuinity/legitimity of news articles. To encounter the inconvenience faced by people i.e our target users because of the spread of fake news, we decided to implement this system.
